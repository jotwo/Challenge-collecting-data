# ToDo List

#### Things that we need to do on Friday

- [ ] Check document "prop_houses" (sara's branch) and see whether there are other methods and/or the current one is reliable (for example, we could check if the dictionary works with other houses). If this is ok,
  - [ ] complete the house properties we need to scrap
  - [ ] scrap info of all links
  - [ ] state conditions for empty (None, null) values (empty rows are not allowed)
  - [ ] prioritize binary and numerical values
  - [ ] merge codes
 
 - [ ] Write a README file
