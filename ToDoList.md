# ToDo List

#### Things that we need to do on Friday

- [x] Check document "prop_houses" (sara's branch) and see whether there are other methods and/or the current one is reliable (for example, we could check if the dictionary works with other houses). If this is ok,
  - [x] complete the house properties we need to scrap
  - [x] scrap info of all links
  - [ ] state conditions for empty (None, null) values (empty rows are not allowed)
  - [x] prioritize binary and numerical values
  - [ ] merge codes
 
 - [ ] Write a README file
 - [ ] Change the name of the repository (it should be called "challenge-collecting-data")
 - [ ] Clean the repo (e.g., delete prop_house)
